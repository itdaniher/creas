tataric acid for resolving enantiomers?

cetirizine -> US 4,525,358

albuterol probably doesn't need chiral separation; R is potent, S is possibly irritating

cetirizine probably doesn't need chiral separation R is potent

The density functional theory (DFT) has reduced the exponentially complex quantum mechanical (QM) N-body
problem to O(N3), by solving N one-electron problems self-consistently instead of an N-electron problem [13,18].â€ 
Unfortunately, DFT-based MD simulations [5] are rarely performed over N ~ 102 atoms because of the O(N3)
computational complexity, which severely limits their scalability. In the past few years, two promising approaches
have emerged toward achieving million-to-billion atom simulations of chemical reactions

The density functional theory (DFT) reduces the exponentially complex quantum N-body problem to a self-consistent matrix eigenvalue problem, which can be solved with O(M**3) operations

Data locality principles are key to developing a scalable parallel computing framework as well. We have developed
a hierarchical cellular decomposition (HCD) framework to map the above O(N) algorithms onto massively parallel
computers with deep memory hierarchies. The HCD maximally exposes data locality and exploits parallelism at
multiple decomposition levels
